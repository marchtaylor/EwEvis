[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marchtaylor/EwEvis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marchtaylor/EwEvis)

Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) visualization. Allows for the creation of 3d visualizations of biomass and throughput statistics. 

**Includes**:

* 3d trophic pyramid. Angle is inversely proportional to mean transfer efficiency (TE) and volume represents either biomass or throughput by trophic level.
* 3d stacked boxes. Volume represents either biomass or throughput by trophic level.


**To load** (using `devtools`):
```
library(devtools)
install_github("marchtaylor/EwEvis")
```


**Examples:**

=============

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marchtaylor/EwEvis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marchtaylor/EwEvis)

Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) visualization. Allows for the creation of 3d visualizations of biomass and throughput statistics.

**Includes**:

-   3d trophic pyramid. Angle is inversely proportional to mean transfer efficiency (TE) and volume represents either biomass or throughput by trophic level.
-   3d stacked boxes. Volume represents either biomass or throughput by trophic level.

**To load** (using `devtools`):

    library(devtools)
    install_github("marchtaylor/EwEvis")

**Examples:** (for additional info and interactive graphics, see [vignette](https://raw.githack.com/marchtaylor/EwEvis/master/doc/EwEvis_vignette.html))
